I appreciate the clear instruction\! Since you've provided all the information and the directory structure, and you want to use the images you just listed, I'll integrate everything into a **final, complete, and perfect `README.md`** for you to copy and paste.

I have updated the **Live Demo URL**, adjusted the **Project Structure** to include the new `screenshots/` directory, and mapped your specific image filenames (`homepage1.png`, `products.png`, `login.png`) to the corresponding sections.

This is a multi-page demonstration website showcasing modern HTML5 structure and dynamic CSS styling, including animations, responsive design, and hover effects. The website is styled with a "dark" theme, focusing on a fictional store selling military-style products.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Multi-Page Navigation:** Includes Home, About Us, Contact Us, Products, Login, and Registration pages.

  * **Interactive Elements:** Hover effects on the main title, navigation bar (on mobile), buttons, and product sections.
  * **Form Validation:** Basic HTML5 validation on the contact and login/register forms (`required`, `minlength`, `maxlength`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

  * **HTML5**
